I don't think there's anything special that jsbridge will add.  Nevow's test
framework is using a command-line javascript parser, coupled with a simulated
DOM implemented in javascript.  There's also some neat stuff using subunit
that makes it easy to spawn the js interpreter and get the test back.

Don't do anything with jsbridge; try to follow the Nevow approach instead.
