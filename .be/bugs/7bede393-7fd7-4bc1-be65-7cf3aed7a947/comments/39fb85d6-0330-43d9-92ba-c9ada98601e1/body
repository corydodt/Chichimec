I want the /app page to be a "Congratulations, it's working!" page which
contains two links to examples:

/app/txgenshi is an example showing off genshi templates
/app/athena is an example showing off athena interactions

Both of these will be resources defined inside chichimec proper, imported by
the generated application, but the pages should contain direct file: links for
examining the source code.

There should be unit tests for this code.
