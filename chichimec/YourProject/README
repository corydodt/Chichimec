{options[projectDir]}
============================================================================

You will probably know best what should be in this README file.  All we can
say with high probability is that this is a web app.

redeploy script
===============

Your end-users will probably want to know about ``bin/redeploy`` if they grabbed
the source code for your app, because that's the easiest way to get a clean
runtime environment they can launch, all batteries included.  Example::

    {options[projectDir]}/bin/redeploy {options[projectDir]}-env
    source {options[projectDir]}-env/bin/activate
    twistd -n {options[projectName]}
